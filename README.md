Git and Github:

Git is a version control software. Git installed and maintained in local system. It is an open ource distributed version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

Github is a website where someone can share code. Github is exclusively cloud based.

Repositories: A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

Clone: When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine. You can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.com, or pull other people's changes from GitHub.com

 Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Create a pull request to ask collaborators for feedback on your changes. Pull request review is so valuable that some repositories require an approving review before pull requests can be merged.

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Why do we need Git branches?
Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on. 

What is branch in Git repository?
A branch represents an independent line of development. ... The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn't let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands. 

A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.

Merge: Once your pull request is approved, merge your pull request. This will automatically merge your branch so that your changes appear on the default branch.

What is version control?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file(s), over time.

How Git works:
Git handles content in snapshots
